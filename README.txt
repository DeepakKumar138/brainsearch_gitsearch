1. The project gitsearch is made in Angular 6 version.
2. For running the attached project one should have @angular/cli latest version installed on system.
3. Other dependencies are nodejs@latest as well as npm@latest which comes with node package.
4. Open libraries like bootstrap 4, font-awesome has been encouraged for this project using cdn in index.html.
5. For the architecture part of the project: it is broken into components, data is passed from child to parent(searchbar to home) as well as parent to child(home to individual cards).
6. Pagination takes care that only 6 cards can be shown on the screen at a time.

Thank you.
